# Convert mirror to mirage
Simple python script to convert from mirror to mirage using regex.

This should be using default python modules so no extra packages to install.

This will not fully convert a project, but just find and replace common Mirror keywords and functions for Mirage ones. 
It is mostly a good first step rather than a full convert.

### Run
**Backup project before running this script**
```sh
python main.py 'path/to/project/Assets/Scripts/'
```
